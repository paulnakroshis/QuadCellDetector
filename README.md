# QuadCellDetector
This folder contains code that simulates the response of a quadrant cell photodiode to the passage of a gaussian profile laser beam across its surface. The quadrant cell is characterized by a radius, and a gap that separates the four active photocell quadrants. This code allows the user to specify the beam shape, the path the beam takes across the detector, and it will output the signals produced by the photodiode: the sum of all four quadrants, the top two minus the bottom two, and the left two minus the right two.
